"1" "VOICE-OVER" "A way out west there was a fella,  fella I want to tell you about, fella  by the name of Jeff Lebowski.  At  least, that was the handle his lovin'  parents gave him, but he never had  much use for it himself.  This  Lebowski, he called himself the Dude.   Now, Dude, that's a name no one would  self-apply where I come from.  But  then, there was a lot about the Dude  that didn't make a whole lot of sense  to me.  And a lot about where he  lived, like- wise.  But then again,  maybe that's why I found the place  s'durned innarestin'."
"2" "VOICE-OVER" "They call Los Angeles the City of  Angels.  I didn't find it to be that  exactly, but I'll allow as there are  some nice folks there.  'Course, I  can't say I seen London, and I never  been to France, and I ain't never  seen no queen in her damn undies as  the fella says.  But I'll tell you  what, after seeing Los Angeles and  thisahere story I'm about to unfold--  wal, I guess I seen somethin' ever'  bit as stupefyin' as ya'd see in any  a those other places, and in English  too, so I can die with a smile on my  face without feelin' like the good  Lord gypped me."
"3" "VOICE-OVER" "Now this story I'm about to unfold  took place back in the early nineties--  just about the time of our conflict  with Sad'm and the Eye-rackies.  I  only mention it 'cause sometimes  there's a man--I won't say a hee-ro,  'cause what's a hee-ro?--but sometimes  there's a man."
"4" "VOICE-OVER" "And I'm talkin' about the Dude here--  sometimes there's a man who, wal,  he's the man for his time'n place,  he fits right in there--and that's  the Dude, in Los Angeles."
"5" "GEORGE BUSH" "This aggression will not stand...  This will not stand!"
"6" "VOICE-OVER" "...and even if he's a lazy man, and  the Dude was certainly that--quite  possibly the laziest in Los Angeles  County."
"7" "VOICE-OVER" "...which would place him high in the  runnin' for laziest worldwide--but  sometimes there's a man... sometimes  there's a man."
"8" "VOICE-OVER" "Wal, I lost m'train of thought here.   But--aw hell, I done innerduced him  enough."
"9" "DUDE" "It's the LeBaron."
"10" "VOICE" "We want that money, Lebowski.  Bunny  said you were good for it."
"11" "VOICE" "Where's the money, Lebowski!"
"12" "VOICE" "Where's the money, Lebowski!"
"13" "VOICE" "WHERE'S THE FUCKING MONEY, SHITHEAD!"
"14" "DUDE" "It's uh, it's down there somewhere.   Lemme take another look."
"15" "VOICE" "Don't fuck with us.  If your wife  owes money to Jackie Treehorn, that  means you owe money to Jackie  Treehorn."
"16" "CHINESE MAN" "Ever thus to deadbeats, Lebowski."
"17" "DUDE" "Oh, man.  Don't do--"
"18" "BLOND MAN" "You see what happens?  You see what  happens, Lebowski?"
"19" "DUDE" "Look, nobody calls me Lebowski.  You  got the wrong guy.  I'm the Dude,  man."
"20" "BLOND MAN" "Your name is Lebowski.  Your wife is  Bunny."
"21" "DUDE" "Bunny?  Look, moron."
"22" "DUDE" "You see a wedding ring?  Does this  place look like I'm fucking married?   All my plants are dead!"
"23" "BLOND MAN" "The fuck is this?"
"24" "DUDE" "Obviously you're not a golfer."
"25" "BLOND MAN" "Woo?"
"26" "WOO" "Yeah?"
"27" "BLOND MAN" "Wasn't this guy supposed to be a  millionaire?"
"28" "WOO" "Uh?"
"29" "WOO" "Fuck."
"30" "BLOND MAN" "What do you think?"
"31" "WOO" "He looks like a fuckin' loser."
"32" "DUDE" "Hey.  At least I'm housebroken."
"33" "WOO" "Fuckin' waste of time."
"34" "BLOND MAN" "Thanks a lot, asshole."
"35" "MAN" "Hot damn, I'm throwin' rocks tonight.   Mark it, Dude."
"36" "WALTER" "This was a valued rug."
"37" "WALTER" "This was, uh--"
"38" "DUDE" "Yeah man, it really tied the room  together--"
"39" "WALTER" "This was a valued, uh."
"40" "DONNY" "What tied the room together, Dude?"
"41" "WALTER" "Were you listening to the story,  Donny?"
"42" "DONNY" "What--"
"43" "WALTER" "Were you listening to the Dude's  story?"
"44" "DONNY" "I was bowling--"
"45" "WALTER" "So you have no frame of reference,  Donny.  You're like a child who  wanders in in the middle of a movie  and wants to know--"
"46" "DUDE" "What's your point, Walter?"
"47" "WALTER" "There's no fucking reason--here's my  point, Dude--there's no fucking reason--"
"48" "DONNY" "Yeah Walter, what's your point?"
"49" "WALTER" "Huh?"
"50" "DUDE" "What's the point of--we all know who  was at fault, so what the fuck are  you talking about?"
"51" "WALTER" "Huh?  No!  What the fuck are you  talking--I'm not--we're talking about  unchecked aggression here--"
"52" "DONNY" "What the fuck is he talking about?"
"53" "DUDE" "My rug."
"54" "WALTER" "Forget it, Donny.  You're out of  your element."
"55" "DUDE" "This Chinaman who peed on my rug, I  can't go give him a bill so what the  fuck are you talking about?"
"56" "WALTER" "What the fuck are you talking about?!   This Chinaman is not the issue!  I'm  talking about drawing a line in the  sand, Dude.  Across this line you do  not, uh--and also, Dude, Chinaman is  not the preferred, uh... Asian-  American.  Please."
"57" "DUDE" "Walter, this is not a guy who built  the railroads, here, this is a guy  who peed on my--"
"58" "WALTER" "What the fuck are you--"
"59" "DUDE" "Walter, he peed on my rug--"
"60" "DONNY" "He peed on the Dude's rug--"
"61" "WALTER" "YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR ELEMENT!  This  Chinaman is not the issue, Dude."
"62" "DUDE" "So who--"
"63" "WALTER" "Jeff Lebowski.  Come on.  This other  Jeffrey Lebowski.  The millionaire.   He's gonna be easier to find anyway  than these two, uh. these two... And  he has the wealth, uh, the resources  obviously, and there is no reason,  no FUCKING reason, why his wife should  go out and owe money and they pee on  your rug.  Am I wrong?"
"64" "DUDE" "No, but--"
"65" "WALTER" "Am I wrong!"
"66" "DUDE" "Yeah, but--"
"67" "WALTER" "Okay. That, uh."
"68" "WALTER" "That rug really tied the room  together, did it not?"
"69" "DUDE" "Fuckin' A."
"70" "DONNY" "And this guy peed on it."
"71" "WALTER" "Donny!  Please!"
"72" "DUDE" "Yeah, I could find this Lebowski guy--"
"73" "DONNY" "His name is Lebowski?  That's your  name, Dude!"
"74" "DUDE" "Yeah, this is the guy, this guy should  compensate me for the fucking rug.   I mean his wife goes out and owes  money and they pee on my rug."
"75" "WALTER" "Thaaat's right Dude; they pee on  your fucking Rug."
"76" "YOUNG MAN" "And this is the study.  You can see  the various commendations, honorary  degrees, et cetera."
"77" "DUDE" "Yes, uh, very impressive."
"78" "YOUNG MAN" "Please, feel free to inspect them."
"79" "DUDE" "I'm not really, uh."
"80" "YOUNG MAN" "Please!  Please!"
"81" "DUDE" "Uh-huh."
"82" "YOUNG MAN" "That's the key to the city of  Pasadena, which Mr. Lebowski was  given two years ago in recognition  of his various civic, uh."
"83" "DUDE" "Uh-huh."
"84" "YOUNG MAN" "That's a Los Angeles Chamber of  Commerce Business Achiever award,  which is given--not necessarily given  every year!  Given only when there's  a worthy, somebody especially--"
"85" "DUDE" "Hey, is this him with Nancy?"
"86" "YOUNG MAN" "That is indeed Mr. Lebowski with the  first lady, yes, taken when--"
"87" "DUDE" "Lebowski on the right?"
"88" "YOUNG MAN" "Of course, Mr. Lebowski on the right,  Mrs. Reagan on the left, taken when--"
"89" "DUDE" "He's handicapped, huh?"
"90" "YOUNG MAN" "Mr. Lebowski is disabled, yes.  And  this picture was taken when Mrs.   Reagan was first lady of the nation,  yes, yes? Not of California."
"91" "DUDE" "Far out."
"92" "YOUNG MAN" "And in fact he met privately with  the President, though unfortunately  there wasn't time for a photo  opportunity."
"93" "DUDE" "Nancy's pretty good."
"94" "YOUNG MAN" "Wonderful woman.  We were very--"
"95" "DUDE" "Are these."
"96" "YOUNG MAN" "These are Mr. Lebowski's children,  so to speak--"
"97" "DUDE" "Different mothers, huh?"
"98" "YOUNG MAN" "No, they--"
"99" "DUDE" "I guess he's pretty, uh, racially  pretty cool--"
"100" "YOUNG MAN" "They're not his, heh-heh, they're  not literally his children; they're  the Little Lebowski Urban Achievers,  inner-city children of promise but  without the--"
"101" "DUDE" "I see."
"102" "YOUNG MAN" "--without the means for higher  education, so Mr. Lebowski has  committed to sending all of them to  college."
"103" "DUDE" "Jeez.  Think he's got room for one  more?"
"104" "YOUNG MAN" "One--oh!  Heh-heh.  You never went  to college?"
"105" "DUDE" "Well, yeah I did, but I spent most  of my time occupying various, um,  administration buildings--"
"106" "YOUNG MAN" "Heh-heh--"
"107" "DUDE" "--smoking thai-stick, breaking into  the ROTC--"
"108" "YOUNG MAN" "Yes, heh--"
"109" "DUDE" "--and bowling.  I'll tell you the  truth, Brandt, I don't remember most  of it.--Jeez!  Fuck me!"
"110" "LEBOWSKI" "Okay sir, you're a Lebowski, I'm a  Lebowski, that's terrific, I'm very  busy so what can I do for you?"
"111" "DUDE" "Well sir, it's this rug I have, really  tied the room together-"
"112" "LEBOWSKI" "You told Brandt on the phone, he  told me.  So where do I fit in?"
"113" "DUDE" "Well they were looking for you, these  two guys, they were trying to--"
"114" "LEBOWSKI" "I'll say it again, all right?  You  told Brandt.  He told me.  I know  what happened. Yes?  Yes?"
"115" "DUDE" "So you know they were trying to piss  on your rug--"
"116" "LEBOWSKI" "Did I urinate on your rug?"
"117" "DUDE" "You mean, did you personally come  and pee on my--"
"118" "LEBOWSKI" "Hello!  Do you speak English?  Parla  usted Inglese?  I'll say it again.   Did I urinate on your rug?"
"119" "DUDE" "Well no, like I said, Woo peed on  the rug--"
"120" "LEBOWSKI" "Hello!  Hello!  So every time--I  just want to understand this, sir--  every time a rug is micturated upon  in this fair city, I have to  compensate the--"
"121" "DUDE" "Come on, man, I'm not trying to scam  anybody here, I'm just--"
"122" "LEBOWSKI" "You're just looking for a handout  like every other--are you employed,  Mr. Lebowski?"
"123" "DUDE" "Look, let me explain something.  I'm  not Mr. Lebowski; you're Mr.   Lebowski.  I'm the Dude.  So that's  what you call me.  That, or Duder.   His Dudeness.  Or El Duderino, if,  you know, you're not into the whole  brevity thing--"
"124" "LEBOWSKI" "Are you employed, sir?"
"125" "DUDE" "Employed?"
"126" "LEBOWSKI" "You don't go out and make a living  dressed like that in the middle of a  weekday."
"127" "DUDE" "Is this a--what day is this?"
"128" "LEBOWSKI" "But I do work, so if you don't mind--"
"129" "DUDE" "No, look.  I do mind.  The Dude minds.   This will not stand, ya know, this  will not stand, man.  I mean, if  your wife owes--"
"130" "LEBOWSKI" "My wife is not the issue here. I  hope that my wife will someday learn  to live on her allowance, which is  ample, but if she doesn't, sir, that  will be her problem, not mine, just  as your rug is your problem, just as  every bum's lot in life is his own  responsibility regardless of whom he  chooses to blame.  I didn't blame  anyone for the loss of my legs, some  chinaman in Korea took them from me  but I went out and achieved anyway.   I can't solve your problems, sir,  only you can."
"131" "DUDE" "Ah fuck it."
"132" "LEBOWSKI" "Sure!  Fuck it!  That's your answer!   Tattoo it on your forehead!  Your  answer to everything!"
"133" "LEBOWSKI" "Your "revolution" is over, Mr.   Lebowski!  Condolences!  The bums  lost!"
"134" "LEBOWSKI" "...My advice is, do what your parents  did!  Get a job, sir!  The bums will  always lose-- do you hear me,  Lebowski?  THE BUMS WILL ALWAYS--"
"135" "HALLWAY" "--in a high coffered hallway.  Brandt  is approaching."
"136" "BRANDT" "How was your meeting, Mr. Lebowski?"
"137" "DUDE" "Okay.  The old man told me to take  any rug in the house."
"138" "BRANDT" "Manolo will load it into your car  for you, uh, Dude."
"139" "DUDE" "It's the LeBaron."
"140" "BRANDT" "Well, enjoy, and perhaps we'll see  you again some time, Dude."
"141" "DUDE" "Yeah sure, if I'm ever in the  neighborhood, need to use the john."
"142" "YOUNG WOMAN" "Blow on them."
"143" "DUDE" "Huh?"
"144" "YOUNG WOMAN" "G'ahead.  Blow."
"145" "DUDE" "You want me to blow on your toes?"
"146" "YOUNG WOMAN" "Uh-huh... I can't blow that far."
"147" "DUDE" "You sure he won't mind?"
"148" "YOUNG WOMAN" "Dieter doesn't care about anything.   He's a nihilist."
"149" "DUDE" "Practicing?"
"150" "YOUNG WOMAN" "You're not blowing."
"151" "BRANDT" "Our guest has to be getting along,  Mrs. Lebowski."
"152" "DUDE" "You're Bunny?"
"153" "BUNNY" "I'll suck your cock for a thousand  dollars."
"154" "BRANDT" "Ha-ha-ha-ha!  Wonderful woman.  Very  free-spirited.  We're all very fond  of her."
"155" "BUNNY" "Brandt can't watch though.  Or he  has to pay a hundred."
"156" "BRANDT" "Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!  That's marvelous."
"157" "DUDE" "I'm just gonna find a cash machine."
"158" "DONNY" "Grasshopper Dude--They're dead in  the water!!"
"159" "DUDE" "Your maples, Carl."
"160" "WALTER" "Way to go, Dude.  If you will it, it  is no dream."
"161" "DUDE" "You're fucking twenty minutes late.   What the fuck is that?"
"162" "WALTER" "Theodore Herzel."
"163" "DUDE" "Huh?"
"164" "WALTER" "State of Israel.  If you will it,  Dude, it is no--"
"165" "DUDE" "What the fuck're you talking about?   The carrier.  What's in the fucking  carrier?"
"166" "WALTER" "Huh?  Oh--Cynthia's Pomeranian.   Can't leave him home alone or he  eats the furniture."
"167" "DUDE" "What the fuck are you--"
"168" "WALTER" "I'm saying, Cynthia's Pomeranian.   I'm looking after it while Cynthia  and Marty Ackerman are in Hawaii."
"169" "DUDE" "You brought a fucking Pomeranian  bowling?"
"170" "WALTER" "What do you mean "brought it bowling"?   I didn't rent it shoes.  I'm not  buying it a fucking beer.  He's not  gonna take your fucking turn, Dude."
"171" "DUDE" "Hey, man, if my fucking ex-wife asked  me to take care of her fucking dog  while she and her boyfriend went to  Honolulu, I'd tell her to go fuck  herself.  Why can't she board it?"
"172" "WALTER" "First of all, Dude, you don't have  an ex, secondly, it's a fucking show  dog with fucking papers.  You can't  board it.  It gets upset, its hair  falls out."
"173" "DUDE" "Hey man--"
"174" "WALTER" "Fucking dog has papers, Dude.--Over  the line!"
"175" "SMOKEY" "Huh?"
"176" "WALTER" "Over the line, Smokey!  I'm sorry.   That's a foul."
"177" "SMOKEY" "Bullshit.  Eight, Dude."
"178" "WALTER" "Excuse me!  Mark it zero.  Next frame."
"179" "SMOKEY" "Bullshit. Walter!"
"180" "WALTER" "This is not Nam.  This is bowling.   There are rules."
"181" "DUDE" "Come on Walter, it's just--it's  Smokey.  So his toe slipped over a  little, it's just a game."
"182" "WALTER" "This is a league game.  This  determines who enters the next round-  robin, am I wrong?"
"183" "SMOKEY" "Yeah, but--"
"184" "WALTER" "Am I wrong!?"
"185" "SMOKEY" "Yeah, but I wasn't over.  Gimme the  marker, Dude, I'm marking it an eight."
"186" "WALTER" "Smokey my friend, you're entering a  world of pain."
"187" "DUDE" "Hey Walter--"
"188" "WALTER" "Mark that frame an eight, you're  entering a world of pain."
"189" "SMOKEY" "I'm not--"
"190" "WALTER" "A world of pain."
"191" "SMOKEY" "Look Dude, I don't hold with this.   This guy is your partner, you should--"
"192" "WALTER" "HAS THE WHOLE WORLD GONE CRAZY?  AM  I THE ONLY ONE HERE WHO GIVES A SHIT  ABOUT THE RULES?  MARK IT ZERO!"
"193" "DUDE" "Walter, they're calling the cops,  put the piece away."
"194" "WALTER" "MARK IT ZERO!"
"195" "SMOKEY" "Walter--"
"196" "WALTER" "YOU THINK I'M FUCKING AROUND HERE?   MARK IT ZERO!!"
"197" "SMOKEY" "All right!  There it is!  It's fucking  zero!"
"198" "SMOKEY" "You happy, you crazy fuck?"
"199" "WALTER" "This is a league game, Smokey!"
"200" "DUDE" "Walter, you can't do that.  These  guys're like me, they're pacificists.   Smokey was a conscientious objector."
"201" "WALTER" "You know Dude, I myself dabbled with  pacifism at one point.  Not in Nam,  of course--"
"202" "DUDE" "And you know Smokey has emotional  problems!"
"203" "WALTER" "You mean--beyond pacifism?"
"204" "DUDE" "He's fragile, man!  He's very fragile!"
"205" "WALTER" "Huh.  I did not know that.  Well,  it's water under the bridge.  And we  do enter the next round-robin, am I  wrong?"
"206" "DUDE" "No, you're not wrong--"
"207" "WALTER" "Am I wrong!"
"208" "DUDE" "You're not wrong, Walter, you're  just an asshole."
"209" "WALTER" "Okay then.  We play Quintana and  O'Brien next week.  They'll be  pushovers."
"210" "DUDE" "Just, just take it easy, Walter."
"211" "WALTER" "That's your answer to everything,  Dude.  And let me point out--pacifism  is not--look at our current situation  with that camelfucker in Iraq--  pacifism is not something to hide  behind."
"212" "DUDE" "Well, just take 't easy, man."
"213" "WALTER" "I'm perfectly calm, Dude."
"214" "DUDE" "Yeah?  Wavin' a gun around?!"
"215" "WALTER" "Calmer than you are."
"216" "DUDE" "Just take it easy, man!"
"217" "WALTER" "Calmer than you are."
"218" "VOICE" "Dude, this is Smokey.  Look, I don't  wanna be a hard-on about this, and I  know it wasn't your fault, but I  just thought it was fair to tell you  that Gene and I will be submitting  this to the League and asking them  to set aside the round.  Or maybe  forfeit it to us--"
"219" "DUDE" "Shit!"
"220" "VOICE" "--so, like I say, just thought, you  know, fair warning.  Tell Walter."
"221" "ANOTHER VOICE" "Mr. Lebowski, this is Brandt at, uh,  well--at Mr. Lebowski's office.   Please call us as soon as is  convenient."
"222" "ANOTHER VOICE" "Mr. Lebowski, this is Fred Dynarski  with the Southern Cal Bowling League.   I just got a, an informal report,  uh, that a uh, a member of your team,  uh, Walter Sobchak, drew a loaded  weapon during league play--"
"223" "DUDE" "Hiya Allan."
"224" "ALLAN" "Dude, I finally got the venue I  wanted.  I'm performing my dance  quintet--you know, my cycle--at Crane  Jackson's Fountain Street Theatre on  Tuesday night, and I'd love it if  you came and gave me notes."
"225" "DUDE" "Sure Allan, I'll be there."
"226" "ALLAN" "Dude, uh, tomorrow is already the  tenth."
"227" "DUDE" "Yeah, yeah I know. Okay."
"228" "ALLAN" "Just, uh, just slip the rent under  my door."
"229" "DUDE" "Yeah, okay."
"230" "VOICE" "--serious infraction, and examine  your standing.  Thank you.  Beep."
"231" "VOICE" "Mr. Lebowski, Brandt again.  Please  do call us when you get in and I'll  send the limo.  Let me assure you--I  hope you're not avoiding this call  because of the rug, which, I assure  you, is not a problem.  We need your  help and, uh--well we would very  much like to see you.  Thank you.   It's Brandt."
"232" "BRANDT" "We've had some terrible news.  Mr.   Lebowski is in seclusion in the West  Wing."
"233" "DUDE" "Huh."
"234" "BRANDT" "Mr. Lebowski."
"235" "LEBOWSKI" "It's funny.  I can look back on a  life of achievement, on challenges  met, competitors bested, obstacles  overcome.  I've accomplished more  than most men, and without the use  of my legs.  What... What makes a  man, Mr. Lebowski?"
"236" "DUDE" "Dude."
"237" "LEBOWSKI" "Huh?"
"238" "DUDE" "I don't know, sir."
"239" "LEBOWSKI" "Is it... is it, being prepared to do  the right thing?  Whatever the price?   Isn't that what makes a man?"
"240" "DUDE" "Sure.  That and a pair of testicles."
"241" "LEBOWSKI" "You're joking.  But perhaps you're  right."
"242" "DUDE" "Mind if I smoke a jay?"
"243" "LEBOWSKI" "Bunny."
"244" "DUDE" "'Scuse me?"
"245" "LEBOWSKI" "Bunny Lebowski... She is the light  of my life.  Are you surprised at my  tears, sir?"
"246" "DUDE" "Fuckin' A."
"247" "LEBOWSKI" "Strong men also cry... Strong men  also cry."
"248" "LEBOWSKI" "I received this fax this morning."
"249" "LEBOWSKI" "As you can see, it is a ransom note.   Sent by cowards.  Men who are unable  to achieve on a level field of play.   Men who will not sign their names.   Weaklings.  Bums."
"250" "DUDE" "Bummer."
"251" "LEBOWSKI" "Brandt will fill you in on the  details."
"252" "BRANDT" "Mr. Lebowski is prepared to make a  generous offer to you to act as  courier once we get instructions for  the money."
"253" "DUDE" "Why me, man?"
"254" "BRANDT" "He suspects that the culprits might  be the very people who, uh, soiled  your rug, and you're in a unique  position to confirm or, uh, disconfirm  that suspicion."
"255" "DUDE" "So he thinks it's the carpet-pissers,  huh?"
"256" "BRANDT" "Well Dude, we just don't know."
"257" "DUDE" "Fucking Quintana--that creep can  roll, man--"
"258" "WALTER" "Yeah, but he's a fucking pervert,  Dude."
"259" "DUDE" "Huh?"
"260" "WALTER" "The man is a sex offender.  With a  record.  Spent six months in Chino  for exposing himself to an eight-  year-old."
"261" "DUDE" "Huh."
"262" "WALTER" "When he moved down to Venice he had  to go door-to-door to tell everyone  he's a pederast."
"263" "DONNY" "What's a pederast, Walter?"
"264" "WALTER" "Shut the fuck up, Donny."
"265" "WALTER" "Anyway.  How much they offer you?"
"266" "DUDE" "Twenty grand.  And of course I still  keep the rug."
"267" "WALTER" "Just for making the hand-off?"
"268" "DUDE" "Yeah."
"269" "DUDE" "...They gave Dude a beeper, so  whenever these guys call--"
"270" "WALTER" "What if it's during a game?"
"271" "DUDE" "I told him if it was during league  play--"
"272" "DONNY" "If what's during league play?"
"273" "WALTER" "Life does not stop and start at your  convenience, you miserable piece of  shit."
"274" "DONNY" "What's wrong with Walter, Dude?"
"275" "DUDE" "I figure it's easy money, it's all  pretty harmless.  I mean she probably  kidnapped herself."
"276" "WALTER" "Huh?"
"277" "DONNY" "What do you mean, Dude?"
"278" "DUDE" "Rug-peers did not do this.  I mean  look at it.  Young trophy wife.   Marries a guy for money but figures  he isn't giving her enough.  She  owes money all over town--"
"279" "WALTER" "That... fucking... bitch!"
"280" "DUDE" "It's all a goddamn fake.  Like Lenin  said, look for the person who will  benefit.  And you will, uh, you know,  you'll, uh, you know what I'm trying  to say--"
"281" "DONNY" "I am the Walrus."
"282" "WALTER" "That fucking bitch!"
"283" "DUDE" "Yeah."
"284" "DONNY" "I am the Walrus."
"285" "WALTER" "Shut the fuck up, Donny!  V.I. Lenin!   Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov!"
"286" "DONNY" "What the fuck is he talking about?"
"287" "WALTER" "That's fucking exactly what happened,  Dude!  That makes me fucking SICK!"
"288" "DUDE" "Yeah, well, what do you care, Walter?"
"289" "DONNY" "Yeah Dude, why is Walter so pissed  off?"
"290" "WALTER" "Those rich fucks!  This whole fucking  thing--I did not watch my buddies  die face down in the muck so that  this fucking strumpet--"
"291" "DUDE" "I don't see any connection to Vietnam,  Walter."
"292" "WALTER" "Well, there isn't a literal  connection, Dude."
"293" "DUDE" "Walter, face it, there isn't any  connection.  It's your roll."
"294" "WALTER" "Have it your way.  The point is--"
"295" "DUDE" "It's your roll--"
"296" "WALTER" "The fucking point is--"
"297" "DUDE" "It's your roll."
"298" "VOICE" "Are you ready to be fucked, man?"
"299" "QUINTANA" "I see you rolled your way into the  semis.  Deos mio, man.  Seamus and  me, we're gonna fuck you up."
"300" "DUDE" "Yeah well, that's just, ya know,  like, your opinion, man."
"301" "QUINTANA" "Let me tell you something, bendeco.   You pull any your crazy shit with  us, you flash a piece out on the  lanes, I'll take it away from you  and stick it up your ass and pull  the fucking trigger 'til it goes  "click"."
"302" "DUDE" "Jesus."
"303" "QUINTANA" "You said it, man.  Nobody fucks with  the Jesus."
"304" "WALTER" "Eight-year-olds, Dude."
"305" "DUDE" "Oh man."
"306" "BRANDT" "They called about eighty minutes  ago.  They want you to take the money  and drive north on the 405.  They'll  call you on the portable phone with  instructions in about forty minutes.   One person only or I'd go with you.   They were very clear on that: one  person only.  What happened to your  jaw?"
"307" "DUDE" "Oh, nothin', you know."
"308" "BRANDT" "Here's the money, and the phone.   Please, Dude, follow whatever  instructions they give."
"309" "DUDE" "Uh-huh."
"310" "BRANDT" "Her life is in your hands."
"311" "DUDE" "Oh, man, don't say that.."
"312" "BRANDT" "Mr. Lebowski asked me to repeat that:  Her life is in your hands."
"313" "DUDE" "Shit."
"314" "BRANDT" "Her life is in your hands, Dude.   And report back to us as soon as  it's done."
"315" "WALTER" "Take the ringer.  I'll drive."
"316" "DUDE" "The what?"
"317" "WALTER" "The ringer!  The ringer, Dude!  Have  they called yet?"
"318" "DUDE" "What the hell is this?"
"319" "WALTER" "My dirty undies.  Laundry, Dude.   The whites."
"320" "DUDE" "Agh--"
"321" "DUDE" "Walter, I'm sure there's a reason  you brought your dirty undies--"
"322" "WALTER" "Thaaaat's right, Dude.  The weight.   The ringer can't look empty."
"323" "DUDE" "Walter--what the fuck are you  thinking?"
"324" "WALTER" "Well you're right, Dude, I got to  thinking.  I got to thinking why  should we settle for a measly fucking  twenty grand--"
"325" "DUDE" "We?  What the fuck we?  You said you  just wanted to come along--"
"326" "WALTER" "My point, Dude, is why should we  settle for twenty grand when we can  keep the entire million.  Am I wrong?"
"327" "DUDE" "Yes you're wrong.  This isn't a  fucking game, Walter--"
"328" "WALTER" "It is a fucking game.  You said so  yourself, Dude--she kidnapped herself--"
"329" "DUDE '" "Yeah, but--"
"330" "DUDE" "Dude here."
"331" "VOICE" "Who is this?"
"332" "DUDE" "Dude the Bagman.  Where do you want  us to go?"
"333" "VOICE" "...Us?"
"334" "DUDE" "Shit... Uh, yeah, you know, me and  the driver.  I'm not handling the  money and driving the car and talking  on the phone all by my fucking--"
"335" "VOICE" "Shut the fuck up. Hello?"
"336" "DUDE" "Yeah?"
"337" "VOICE" "Okay, listen--"
"338" "WALTER" "Dude, are you fucking this up?"
"339" "VOICE" "Who is that?"
"340" "DUDE" "The driver man, I told you--"
"341" "DUDE" "Oh shit.  Walter."
"342" "WALTER" "What the fuck is going on there?"
"343" "DUDE" "They hung up, Walter!  You fucked it  up!  You fucked it up!  Her life was  in our hands!"
"344" "WALTER" "Easy, Dude."
"345" "DUDE" "We're screwed now!  We don't get  shit and they're gonna kill her!   We're fucked, Walter!"
"346" "WALTER" "Dude, nothing is fucked.  Come on.   You're being very unDude.  They'll  call back.  Look, she kidnapped her--"
"347" "WALTER" "Ya see?  Nothing is fucked up here,  Dude.  Nothing is fucked.  These  guys are fucking amateurs--"
"348" "DUDE" "Shutup, Walter!  Don't fucking say  peep when I'm doing business here."
"349" "WALTER" "Okay Dude.  Have it your way."
"350" "WALTER" "But they're amateurs."
"351" "DUDE" "Dude here."
"352" "VOICE" "Okay, vee proceed.  But only if there  is no funny stuff."
"353" "DUDE" "Yeah."
"354" "VOICE" "So no funny stuff.  Okay?"
"355" "DUDE" "Hey, just tell me where the fuck you  want us to go."
"356" "DUDE" "That was the sign."
"357" "WALTER" "Yeah.  So as long as we get her back,  nobody's in a position to complain.   And we keep the baksheesh."
"358" "DUDE" "Terrific, Walter.  But you haven't  told me how we get her back.  Where  is she?"
"359" "WALTER" "That's the simple part, Dude.  When  we make the handoff, I grab the guy  and beat it out of him."
"360" "WALTER" "...Huh?"
"361" "DUDE" "Yeah.  That's a great plan, Walter.   That's fucking ingenious, if I  understand it correctly.  That's a  Swiss fucking watch."
"362" "WALTER" "Thaaat's right, Dude.  The beauty of  this is its simplicity. If the plan  gets too complex something always  goes wrong.  If there's one thing I  learned in Nam--"
"363" "DUDE" "Dude."
"364" "VOICE" "You are approaching a vooden britch.   When you cross it you srow ze bag  from ze left vindow of ze moving  kar.  Do not slow down.  Vee vatch  you."
"365" "DUDE" "FUCK."
"366" "WALTER" "What'd he say?  Where's the hand-  off?"
"367" "DUDE" "There is no fucking hand-off, Walter!   At a wooden bridge we throw the money  out of the car!"
"368" "WALTER" "Huh?"
"369" "DUDE" "We throw the money out of the moving  car!"
"370" "WALTER" "We can't do that, Dude.  That fucks  up our plan."
"371" "DUDE" "Well call them up and explain it to  'em, Walter!  Your plan is so fucking  simple, I'm sure they'd fucking  understand it!  That's the beauty of  it Walter!"
"372" "WALTER" "Wooden bridge, huh?"
"373" "DUDE" "I'm throwing the money, Walter!   We're not fucking around!"
"374" "WALTER" "The bridge is coming up!  Gimme the  ringer, Dude!  Chop-chop!"
"375" "DUDE" "Fuck that!  I love you, Walter, but  sooner or later you're gonna have to  face the fact that you're a goddamn  moron."
"376" "WALTER" "Okay, Dude.  No time to argue.  Here's  the bridge--"
"377" "DUDE" "Walter!"
"378" "WALTER" "Your wheel, Dude!  I'm rolling out!"
"379" "DUDE" "What the fuck?"
"380" "WALTER" "Your wheel!  At fifteen em-pee-aitch  I roll out!  I double back, grab one  of 'em and beat it out of him!  The  uzi!"
"381" "DUDE" "Uzi?"
"382" "WALTER" "You didn't think I was rolling out  of here naked!"
"383" "DUDE" "Walter, please--"
"384" "WALTER" "Fifteen!  This is it, Dude!  Let's  take that hill!"
"385" "DUDE" "WE HAVE IT!  WE HAVE IT!!"
"386" "DUDE" "WE HAVE IT!!... We have it!"
"387" "WALTER" "Ahh fuck it, let's go bowling."
"388" "WALTER" "Aitz chaim he, Dude.  As the ex used  to say."
"389" "DUDE" "What the fuck is that supposed to  mean?  What the fuck're we gonna  tell Lebowski?"
"390" "WALTER" "Huh?  Oh, him, yeah.  Well I don't  see, um-- what exactly is the problem?"
"391" "DUDE" "Huh?  The problem is--what do you  mean what's the--there's no--we didn't--  they're gonna kill that poor woman--"
"392" "WALTER" "What the fuck're you talking about?   That poor woman--that poor slut--  kidnapped herself, Dude.  You said  so yourself--"
"393" "DUDE" "No, Walter!  I said I thought she  kidnapped herself!  You're the one  who's so fucking certain--"
"394" "WALTER" "That's right, Dude, I am certain--"
"395" "DONNY" "They posted the next round of the  tournament--"
"396" "WALTER" "Donny, shut the f--when do we play?"
"397" "DONNY" "This Saturday.  Quintana and--"
"398" "WALTER" "Saturday!  Well they'll have to  reschedule."
"399" "DUDE" "Walter, what'm I gonna tell Lebowski?"
"400" "WALTER" "I told that fuck down at the league  office--who's in charge of scheduling?"
"401" "DUDE" "Walter--"
"402" "DONNY" "Burkhalter."
"403" "WALTER" "I told that kraut a fucking thousand  times I don't roll on shabbas."
"404" "DONNY" "It's already posted."
"405" "WALTER" "WELL THEY CAN FUCKING UN-POST IT!"
"406" "DUDE" "Who gives a shit, Walter?  What about  that poor woman?  What do we tell--"
"407" "WALTER" "C'mon Dude, eventually she'll get  sick of her little game and, you  know, wander back--"
"408" "DONNY" "How come you don't roll on Saturday,  Walter?"
"409" "WALTER" "I'm shomer shabbas."
"410" "DONNY" "What's that, Walter?"
"411" "DUDE" "Yeah, and in the meantime what do I  tell Lebowski?"
"412" "WALTER" "Saturday is shabbas.  Jewish day of  rest.  Means I don't work, I don't  drive a car, I don't fucking ride in  a car, I don't handle money, I don't  turn on the oven, and I sure as shit  don't fucking roll!"
"413" "DONNY" "Sheesh."
"414" "DUDE" "Walter, how--"
"415" "WALTER" "Shomer shabbas."
"416" "DUDE" "That's it.  I'm out of here."
"417" "WALTER" "For Christ's sake, Dude."
"418" "DONNY" "Oh yeah, how'd it go?"
"419" "WALTER" "Went alright.  Dude's car got a little  dinged up--"
"420" "DUDE" "But Walter, we didn't make the fucking  hand-off!  They didn't get, the  fucking money and they're gonna--  they're gonna--"
"421" "WALTER" "Yeah yeah, "kill that poor woman.""
"422" "WALTER" "Kill that poor woman."
"423" "DONNY" "Walter, if you can't ride in a car,  how d'you get around on Shammas--"
"424" "WALTER" "Really, Dude, you surprise me.   They're not gonna kill shit.  They're  not gonna do shit.  What can they  do?  Fuckin' amateurs.  And meanwhile,  look at the bottom line.  Who's  sitting on a million fucking dollars?   Am I wrong?"
"425" "DUDE" "Walter--"
"426" "WALTER" "Who's got a fucking million fucking  dollars parked in the trunk of our  car out here?"
"427" "DUDE" ""Our" car, Walter?"
"428" "WALTER" "And what do they got, Dude?  My dirty  undies.  My fucking whites--Say,  where is the car?"
"429" "DONNY" "Who has your undies, Walter?"
"430" "WALTER" "Where's your car, Dude?"
"431" "DUDE" "You don't know, Walter?  You seem to  know the answer to everything else!"
"432" "WALTER" "Hmm.  Well, we were in a handicapped  spot.  It, uh, it was probably towed."
"433" "DUDE" "It's been stolen, Walter!  You fucking  know it's been stolen!"
"434" "WALTER" "Well, certainly that's a possibility,  Dude--"
"435" "DUDE" "Aw, fuck it."
"436" "DONNY" "Where you going, Dude?"
"437" "DUDE" "I'm going home, Donny."
"438" "DONNY" "Your phone's ringing, Dude."
"439" "DUDE" "Thank you, Donny."
"440" "DUDE" "1972 Pontiac LeBaron."
"441" "YOUNGER COP" "Color?"
"442" "DUDE" "Green.  Some brown, or, uh, rust,  coloration."
"443" "YOUNGER COP" "And was there anything of value in  the car?"
"444" "DUDE" "Huh?  Oh.  Yeah.  Tape deck.  Couple  of Creedence tapes.  And there was  a, uh... my briefcase."
"445" "YOUNGER COP" "In the briefcase?"
"446" "DUDE" "Papers.  Just papers.  You know, my  papers.  Business papers."
"447" "YOUNGER COP" "And what do you do, sir?"
"448" "DUDE" "I'm unemployed."
"449" "OLDER COP" "...Most people, we're working nights,  they offer us coffee."
"450" "DUDE" "...Me, I don't drink coffee.  But  it's nice when they offer."
"451" "DUDE" "...Also, my rug was stolen."
"452" "YOUNGER COP" "Your rug was in the car."
"453" "DUDE" "No.  Here."
"454" "YOUNGER COP" "Separate incidents?"
"455" "OLDER COP" "Snap out of it, son."
"456" "DUDE" "You find them much?  Stolen cars?"
"457" "YOUNGER COP" "Sometimes.  I wouldn't hold out much  hope for the tape deck though.  Or  the Creedence tapes."
"458" "DUDE" "And the, uh, the briefcase?"
"459" "FEMALE VOICE ON MACHINE" "Mr. Lebowski, I'd like to see you.   Call when you get home and I'll send  a car for you.  My name is Maude  Lebowski.  I'm the woman who took  the rug."
"460" "OLDER COP" "Well, I guess we can close the file  on that one."
"461" "VOICE" "I'll be with you in a minute, Mr.   Lebowski."
"462" "VOICE" "All right, we'll do the blue tomorrow.   Elfranco.  Pedro.  Help me down."
"463" "MAUDE" "Does the female form make you  uncomfortable, Mr. Lebowski?"
"464" "DUDE" "Is that what that's a picture of?"
"465" "MAUDE" "In a sense, yes.  Elfranco, my robe.   My art has been commended as being  strongly vaginal.  Which bothers  some men.  The word itself makes  some men uncomfortable.  Vagina."
"466" "DUDE" "Oh yeah?"
"467" "MAUDE" "Yes, they don't like hearing it and  find it difficult to say.  Whereas  without batting an eye a man will  refer to his "dick" or his "rod" or  his "Johnson"."
"468" "DUDE" ""Johnson"?"
"469" "MAUDE" "Thank you."
"470" "MAUDE" "All right, Mr. Lebowski, let's get  down to cases.  My father told me  he's agreed to let you have the rug,  but it was a gift from me to my late  mother, and so was not his to give.   Now.  As for this... "kidnapping"--"
"471" "DUDE" "Huh?"
"472" "MAUDE" "Yes, I know about it.  And I know  that you acted as courier.  And let  me tell you something:  the whole  thing stinks to high heaven."
"473" "DUDE" "Right, but let me explain something  about that rug--"
"474" "MAUDE" "Do you like sex, Mr. Lebowski?"
"475" "DUDE" "Excuse me?"
"476" "MAUDE" "Sex.  The physical act of love.   Coitus.  Do you like it?"
"477" "DUDE" "I was talking about my rug."
"478" "MAUDE" "You're not interested in sex?"
"479" "DUDE" "You mean coitus?"
"480" "MAUDE" "I like it too.  It's a male myth  about feminists that we hate sex.   It can be a natural, zesty enterprise.   But unfortunately there are some  people--it is called satyriasis in  men, nymphomania in women--who engage  in it compulsively and without joy."
"481" "DUDE" "Oh, no."
"482" "MAUDE" "Yes Mr. Lebowski, these unfortunate  souls cannot love in the true sense  of the word.  Our mutual acquaintance  Bunny is one of these."
"483" "DUDE" "Listen, Maude, I'm sorry if your  stepmother is a nympho, but I don't  see what it has to do with--do you  have any kalhua?"
"484" "MAUDE" "Take a look at this, sir."
"485" "DIETER" "Hello.  Nein dizbatcher says zere  iss problem mit deine kable."
"486" "DUDE" "Shit, I know that guy.  He's a  nihilist."
"487" "MAUDE" "And you recognize her, of course."
"488" "BUNNY" "The TV is in here."
"489" "DIETER" "Za, okay, I bring mein toolz."
"490" "BUNNY" "This is my friend Shari.  She just  came over to use the shower."
"491" "MAUDE" "The story is ludicrous."
"492" "DIETER" "Mein nommen iss Karl.  Is hard to  verk in zese clozes--"
"493" "MAUDE" "Lord.  You can imagine where it goes  from here."
"494" "DUDE" "He fixes the cable?"
"495" "MAUDE" "Don't be factious, Jeffrey.  Little  matter to me that this woman chose  to pursue a career in pornography,  nor that she has been "banging" Jackie  Treehorn, to use the parlance of our  times.  However.  I am one of two  trustees of the Lebowski Foundation,  the other being my father.  The  Foundation takes youngsters from  Watts and--"
"496" "DUDE" "Shit yeah, the achievers."
"497" "MAUDE" "Little Lebowski Urban Achievers,  yes, and proud we are of all of them.   I asked my father about his withdrawal  of a million dollars from the  Foundation account and he told me  about this "abduction", but I tell  you it is preposterous.  This  compulsive fornicator is taking my  father for the proverbial ride."
"498" "DUDE" "Yeah, but my-"
"499" "MAUDE" "I'm getting to your rug. My father  and I don't get along; he doesn't  approve of my lifestyle and, needless  to say, I don't approve of his.   Still, I hardly wish to make my  father's embezzlement a police matter,  so I'm proposing that you try to  recover the money from the people  you delivered it to."
"500" "DUDE" "Well--sure, I could do that--"
"501" "MAUDE" "If you successfully do so, I will  compensate you to the tune of 10% of  the recovered sum."
"502" "DUDE" "A hundred."
"503" "MAUDE" "Thousand, yes, bones or clams or  whatever you call them."
"504" "DUDE" "Yeah, but what about--"
"505" "MAUDE" "--your rug, yes, well with that money  you can buy any number of rugs that  don't have sentimental value for me.   And I am sorry about that crack on  the jaw."
"506" "DUDE" "Oh that's okay, I hardly even--"
"507" "MAUDE" "Here's the name and number of a doctor  who will look at it for you.  You  will receive no bill.  He's a good  man, and thorough."
"508" "DUDE" "That's really thoughtful but I--"
"509" "MAUDE" "Please see him, Jeffrey.  He's a  good man, and thorough."
"510" "DRIVER" "--So he says, "My son can't hold a  job, my daughter's married to a  fuckin' loser, and I got a rash on  my ass so bad I can't hardly siddown.   But you know me.  I can't complain.""
"511" "DUDE" "Fuckin' A, man.  I got a rash.   Fuckin' A, man.  I gotta tell ya  Tony."
"512" "TONY" "Aw, forget about it."
"513" "DUDE" "Yeah, man!  Fuck it!  I can't be  worrying about that shit.  Life goes  on!"
"514" "TONY" "Home sweet home, Mr. L.  Who's your  friend in the Volkswagon?"
"515" "DUDE" "Huh?"
"516" "DUDE" "When did he-"
"517" "SECOND CHAUFFEUR" "Into the limo, you sonofabitch.  No  arguments."
"518" "DUDE" "Fuck, man!  There's a beverage here!"
"519" "LEBOWSKI" "Start talking and talk fast you lousy  bum!"
"520" "BRANDT" "We've been frantically trying to  reach you, Dude."
"521" "LEBOWSKI" "Where's my goddamn money, you bum?!"
"522" "DUDE" "Well we--I don't--"
"523" "LEBOWSKI" "They did not receive the money, you  nitwit!  They did not receive the  goddamn money.  HER LIFE WAS IN YOUR  HANDS!"
"524" "BRANDT" "This is our concern, Dude."
"525" "DUDE" "No, man, nothing is fucked here--"
"526" "LEBOWSKI" "NOTHING IS FUCKED! THE GODDAMN PLANE  HAS CRASHED INTO THE MOUNTAIN!"
"527" "DUDE" "C'mon man, who're you gonna believe?   Those guys are--we dropped off the  damn money--"
"528" "LEBOWSKI" "WHAT?!"
"529" "DUDE" "I--the royal we, you know, the  editorial--I dropped off the money,  exactly as per--Look, I've got certain  information, certain things have  come to light, and uh, has it ever  occurred to you, man, that given the  nature of all this new shit, that,  uh, instead of running around blaming  me, that this whole thing might just  be, not, you know, not just such a  simple, but uh--you know?"
"530" "LEBOWSKI" "What in God's holy name are you  blathering about?"
"531" "DUDE" "I'll tell you what I'm blathering  about!  I got information--new shit  has come to light and--shit, man!   She kidnapped herself!"
"532" "DUDE" "Well sure, look at it!  Young trophy  wife, I mean, in the parlance of our  times, owes money all over town,  including to known pornographers-- and that's cool, that's cool--but  I'm saying, she needs money, and of  course they're gonna say they didn't  get it 'cause she wants more, man,  she's gotta feed the monkey, I mean--  hasn't that ever occurred to you...?   Sir?"
"533" "LEBOWSKI" "No.  No Mr. Lebowski, that had not  occurred to me."
"534" "BRANDT" "That had not occurred to us, Dude."
"535" "DUDE" "Well, okay, you're not privy to all  the new shit, so uh, you know, but  that's what you pay me for.  Speaking  of which, would it be possible for  me to get my twenty grand in cash?   I gotta check this with my accountant  of course, but my concern is that,  you know, it could bump me into a  higher tax--"
"536" "LEBOWSKI" "Brandt, give him the envelope."
"537" "DUDE" "Well, okay, if you've already made  out the check."
"538" "BRANDT" "We received it this morning."
"539" "LEBOWSKI" "Since you have failed to achieve,  even in the modest task that was  your charge, since you have stolen  my money, and since you have  unrepentantly betrayed my trust."
"540" "LEBOWSKI" "I have no choice but to tell these  bums that they should do whatever is  necessary to recover their money  from you, Jeffrey Lebowski.  And  with Brandt as my witness, tell you  this:  Any further harm visited upon  Bunny, shall be visited tenfold upon  your head."
"541" "LEBOWSKI" "...By God sir.  I will not abide  another toe."
"542" "WALTER" "That wasn't her toe."
"543" "DUDE" "Whose toe was it, Walter?"
"544" "WALTER" "How the fuck should I know?  I do  know that nothing about it indicates--"
"545" "DUDE" "The nail polish, Walter."
"546" "WALTER" "Fine, Dude.  As if it's impossible  to get some nail polish, apply it to  someone else's toe--"
"547" "DUDE" "Someone else's--where the fuck are  they gonna--"
"548" "WALTER" "You want a toe?  I can get you a  toe, believe me.  There are ways,  Dude.  You don't wanna know about  it, believe me."
"549" "DUDE" "But Walter--"
"550" "WALTER" "I'll  get  you  a  toe by  this  afternoon--with nail polish. These  fucking amateurs.  They send us a  toe, we're  supposed to shit ourselves  with fear.  Jesus Christ. My point  is--"
"551" "DUDE" "They're gonna kill her, Walter, and  then they're gonna kill me--"
"552" "WALTER" "Well that's just, that's the stress  talking, Dude.  So far we have what  looks to me like a series of  victimless crimes--"
"553" "DUDE" "What about the toe?"
"554" "WALTER" "FORGET ABOUT THE FUCKING TOE!"
"555" "WAITRESS" "Could you please keep your voices  down--this is a family restaurant."
"556" "WALTER" "Oh, please dear!  I've got news for  you: the Supreme Court has roundly  rejected prior restraint!"
"557" "DUDE" "Walter, this isn't a First Amendment  thing."
"558" "WAITRESS" "Sir, if you don't calm down I'm going  to have to ask you to leave."
"559" "WALTER" "Lady, I got buddies who died face-  down in the muck so you and I could  enjoy this family restaurant!"
"560" "DUDE" "All right, I'm leaving.  I'm sorry  ma'am."
"561" "WALTER" "Don't run away from this, Dude!   Goddamnit, this affects all of us!"
"562" "WALTER" "Our basic freedoms!"
"563" "WALTER" "I'm staying.  Finishing my coffee."
"564" "WALTER" "Finishing my coffee."
"565" "VOICE THROUGH MACHINE" "Mr. Lebowski, this is Duty Officer  Rolvaag of the L.A.P.D."
"566" "VOICE THROUGH MACHINE" "We've recovered your vehicle.  It  can be claimed at the North Hollywood  Auto Circus there on Victory."
"567" "DUDE" "Far out.  Far fuckin' out."
"568" "MESSAGE" "You'll just need to present a--"
"569" "DUDE" "Hunh?"
"570" "DUDE" "Hey!  This is a private residence,  man!"
"571" "DUDE" "Nice marmot."
"572" "FIRST MAN" "Vee vant zat money, Lebowski."
"573" "SECOND MAN" "You think veer kidding und making  mit de funny stuff?"
"574" "THIRD MAN" "Vee could do things you only dreamed  of, Lebowski."
"575" "SECOND MAN" "Ja, vee could really do it, Lebowski.   Vee belief in nossing."
"576" "DUDE" "Jesus!"
"577" "DIETER" "Vee belief in nossing, Lebowski!   NOSSING!!"
"578" "DUDE" "Jesus Christ!"
"579" "FIRST MAN" "Tomorrow vee come back und cut off  your chonson."
"580" "DUDE" "Excuse me?"
"581" "FIRST MAN" "I SAY VEE CUT OFF YOUR CHONSON!"
"582" "SECOND MAN" "Just sink about zat, Lebowski."
"583" "FIRST MAN" "Ja, your viggly penis, Lebowski."
"584" "SECOND MAN" "Ja, und maybe vee stamp on it und  skvush it, Lebowski!"
"585" "POLICEMAN" "You're lucky she wasn't chopped, Mr.   Lebowski. Must've been a joyride  situation; they abandoned the car  once they hit the retaining wall."
"586" "POLICEMAN" "These were on the road next to the  car.  You'll have to get in on the  other side."
"587" "DUDE" "My fucking briefcase!  It's not here!"
"588" "POLICEMAN" "Yeah, sorry, I saw that on the report.   You're lucky they left the tape deck  though."
"589" "DUDE" "My fucking briefcase!  Jesus--what's  that smell?"
"590" "POLICEMAN" "Uh, yeah.  Probably a vagrant, slept  in the car.  Or perhaps just used it  as a toilet, and moved on."
"591" "DUDE" "When will you find these guys?  I  mean, do you have any promising leads?"
"592" "POLICEMAN" "Leads, yeah.  I'll just check with  the boys down at the Crime Lab.   They've assigned four more detectives  to the case, got us working in shifts."
"593" "DONNY" "And then they're gonna stamp on it?!"
"594" "WALTER" "Oh for Christ--will you shut the  fuck up, Donny."
"595" "DUDE" "I figure my only hope is that the  big Lebowski kills me before the  Germans can cut my dick off."
"596" "WALTER" "Now that is ridiculous, Dude.  No  one is going to cut your dick off."
"597" "DUDE" "Thanks Walter."
"598" "WALTER" "Not if I have anything to say about  it."
"599" "DUDE" "Yeah, thanks Walter.  That gives me  a very secure feeling."
"600" "WALTER" "Dude--"
"601" "DUDE" "That makes me feel all warm inside."
"602" "WALTER" "Now Dude--"
"603" "DUDE" "This whole fucking thing--I could be  sitting here with just pee-stains on  my rug."
"604" "WALTER" "Fucking Germans.  Nothing changes.   Fucking Nazis."
"605" "DONNY" "They were Nazis, Dude?"
"606" "WALTER" "Come on, Donny, they were threatening  castration!"
"607" "DONNY" "Uh-huh."
"608" "WALTER" "Are you gonna split hairs?"
"609" "DONNY" "No--"
"610" "WALTER" "Am I wrong?"
"611" "DONNY" "Well--"
"612" "DUDE" "They're nihilists."
"613" "WALTER" "Huh?"
"614" "DUDE" "They kept saying they believe in  nothing."
"615" "WALTER" "Nihilists!  Jesus."
"616" "WALTER" "Say what you like about the tenets  of National Socialism, Dude, at least  it's an ethos."
"617" "DUDE" "Yeah."
"618" "WALTER" "And let's also not forget--let's not  forget, Dude--that keeping wildlife,  an amphibious rodent, for uh,  domestic, you know, within the city--  that isn't legal either."
"619" "DUDE" "What're you, a fucking park ranger  now?"
"620" "WALTER" "No, I'm--"
"621" "DUDE" "Who gives a shit about the fucking  marmot!"
"622" "WALTER" "--We're sympathizing here, Dude--"
"623" "DUDE" "Fuck your sympathy!  I don't need  your sympathy, man, I need my fucking  Johnson!"
"624" "DONNY" "What do you need that for, Dude?"
"625" "WALTER" "You gotta buck up, man, you can't go  into the tournament with this negative  attitude--"
"626" "DUDE" "Fuck the tournament!  Fuck you,  Walter!"
"627" "WALTER" "Fuck the tournament?!"
"628" "WALTER" "Okay Dude.  I can see you don't want  to be cheered up.  C'mon Donny, let's  go get a lane."
"629" "DUDE" "Another Caucasian, Gary."
"630" "VOICE" "Right, Dude."
"631" "DUDE" "Friends like these, huh Gary."
"632" "GARY" "That's right, Dude."
"633" "MAN" "D'ya have a good sarsaparilla?"
"634" "BARTENDER" "Sioux City Sarsaparilla."
"635" "THE STRANGER" "That's a good one."
"636" "THE STRANGER" "How ya doin' there, Dude?"
"637" "DUDE" "Ahh, not so good, man."
"638" "THE STRANGER" "One a those days, huh.  Wal, a wiser  fella than m'self once said, sometimes  you eat the bar and sometimes the  bar, wal, he eats you."
"639" "DUDE" "Uh-huh.  That some kind of Eastern  thing?"
"640" "THE STRANGER" "Far from it."
"641" "DUDE" "Mm."
"642" "THE STRANGER" "Much obliged."
"643" "THE STRANGER" "I like your style, Dude."
"644" "DUDE" "Well I like your style too, man.   Got a whole cowboy thing goin'."
"645" "THE STRANGER" "Thankie... Just one thing, Dude.   D'ya have to use s'many cuss words?"
"646" "DUDE" "The fuck are you talking about?"
"647" "THE STRANGER" "Okay, have it your way."
"648" "THE STRANGER" "Take it easy, Dude."
"649" "DUDE" "Yeah.  Thanks man."
"650" "VOICE" "Dude!  Dude!"
"651" "MAUDE" "Jeffrey, you haven't gone to the  doctor."
"652" "DUDE" "No it's fine, really, uh--"
"653" "MAUDE" "Do you have any news regarding my  father's money?"
"654" "DUDE" "I, uh... money, yeah, I gotta  respecfully, 69 you know, tender my  resignation on that matter, 'cause  it looks like your mother really was  kidnapped after all."
"655" "MAUDE" "She most certainly was not!"
"656" "DUDE" "Hey man, why don't you fucking listen  occasionally?  You might learn  something.  Now I got--"
"657" "MAUDE" "And please don't call her my mother."
"658" "DUDE" "Now I got--"
"659" "MAUDE" "She is most definitely the perpetrator  and not the victim."
"660" "DUDE" "I'm telling you, I got definitive  evidence--"
"661" "MAUDE" "From who?"
"662" "DUDE" "The main guy, Dieter--"
"663" "MAUDE" "Dieter Hauff?"
"664" "DUDE" "Well--yeah, I guess--"
"665" "MAUDE" "Her "co-star" in the beaver picture?"
"666" "DUDE" "Beaver?  You mean vagina?--I mean,  you know him?"
"667" "MAUDE" "Dieter has been on the fringes of--  well, of everything in L.A., for  about twenty years.  Look at my LP's.   under 'Autobahn.'"
"668" "MAUDE" "That was his group--they released  one album in the mid-seventies."
"669" "DUDE" "Roy Orbison... Pink Floyd."
"670" "MAUDE" "Huh?  Autobahn.  A-u-t-o.  Their  music is a sort of--ugh--techno-pop."
"671" "DUDE" "Jeez.  I miss vinyl."
"672" "MAUDE" "Is he pretending to be the abductor?"
"673" "DUDE" "Well... yeah--"
"674" "MAUDE" "Look, Jeffrey, you don't really kidnap  someone that you're acquainted with.   You can't get away with it if the  hostage knows who you are."
"675" "DUDE" "Well yeah... I know that."
"676" "MAUDE" "So Dieter has the money?"
"677" "DUDE" "Well, no, not exactly.  It's a  complicated case, Maude.  Lotta ins.   Lotta outs.  And a lotta strands to  keep in my head, man.  Lotta strands  in old Duder's--"
"678" "MAUDE" "Do you still have that doctor's  number?"
"679" "DUDE" "Huh?  No, really, I don't even have  the bruise any more, I--"
"680" "MAUDE" "Please Jeffrey.  I don't want to be  responsible for any delayed after-  effects."
"681" "DUDE" "Delayed after-eff--"
"682" "MAUDE" "I want you to see him immediately."
"683" "MAUDE" "I'll see if he's available.  He's a  good man, and thorough."
"684" "VOICE" "Could you slide your shorts down  please, Mr.  Lebowski?"
"685" "DUDE" "Huh?  No, she, she hit me right here."
"686" "VOICE" "I understand sir.  Could you slide  your shorts down please?"
"687" "DUDE" "Fuck Me."
"688" "DUDE" "Fuckola, man."
"689" "WALTER" "He lives in North Hollywood on  Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger--"
"690" "DUDE" "The In-and-Out Burger is on Camrose."
"691" "WALTER" "Near the In-and-Out Burger--"
"692" "DONNY" "Those are good burgers, Walter."
"693" "WALTER" "Shut the fuck up, Donny.  This kid  is in the ninth grade, Dude, and his  father is--are you ready for this?--  Arthur Digby Sellers."
"694" "DUDE" "Who the fuck is that?"
"695" "WALTER" "Huh?"
"696" "DUDE" "Who the fuck is Arthur Digby Sellers?"
"697" "WALTER" "Who the f--have you ever heard of a  little show called Branded, Dude?"
"698" "DUDE" "Yeah."
"699" "WALTER" "All but one man died?  There at Bitter  Creek?"
"700" "DUDE" "Yeah yeah, I know the fucking show  Walter, so what?"
"701" "WALTER" "Fucking Arthur Digby Sellers wrote  156 episodes, Dude."
"702" "DUDE" "Uh-huh."
"703" "WALTER" "The bulk of the series."
"704" "DUDE" "Uh-huh."
"705" "WALTER" "Not exactly a lightweight."
"706" "DUDE" "No."
"707" "WALTER" "And yet his son is a fucking dunce."
"708" "DUDE" "Uh."
"709" "WALTER" "Yeah, go figure.  Well we'll go out  there after the, uh, the."
"710" "WALTER" "What have you.  We'll, uh--"
"711" "DONNY" "We'll be near the In-and-Out Burger."
"712" "WALTER" "Shut the fuck up, Donny.  We'll, uh,  brace the kid--he'll be a pushover.   We'll get that fucking money, if he  hasn't spent it already.  Million  fucking clams. And yes, we'll be  near the, uh--some burgers, some  beers, a few laughs.  Our fucking  troubles are over, Dude."
"713" "DUDE" "Fuck me, man!  That kid's already  spent all the money!"
"714" "WALTER" "Hardly Dude, a new 'vette?  The kid's  still got, oh, 96 to 97 thousand,  depending on the options.  Wait in  the car, Donny."
"715" "WOMAN" "Jace?"
"716" "WALTER" "Hello, Pilar?  My name is Walter  Sobchak, we spoke on the phone, this  is my associate Jeffrey Lebowski."
"717" "WOMAN" "Jace."
"718" "WALTER" "May we uh, we wanted to talk about  little Larry.  May we come in?"
"719" "WOMAN" "Jace."
"720" "PILAR" "Larry!  Sweetie!  Dat mang is here!"
"721" "WALTER" "That's him, Dude. And a good day to you, sir."
"722" "PILAR" "See down, please."
"723" "WALTER" "Thank you, ma'am."
"724" "WALTER" "Does he, uh... Is he still writing?"
"725" "PILAR" "No, no.  He has healt' problems."
"726" "WALTER" "Uh-huh."
"727" "WALTER" "I just want to say, sir, that we're  both enormous--on a personal level,  Branded, especially the early  episodes, has been a source of, uh,  inspir---"
"728" "PILAR" "See down, Sweetie.  These are the  policeman--"
"729" "WALTER" "No ma'am, I didn't mean to give the  impression that we're police exactly.   We're hoping that it will not be  necessary to call the police."
"730" "WALTER" "But that is up to little Larry here.   Isn't it, Larry?"
"731" "WALTER" "Is this your homework, Larry?"
"732" "WALTER" "Is this your homework, Larry?"
"733" "DUDE" "Look, man, did you--"
"734" "WALTER" "Dude, please!...  Is this your  homework, Larry?"
"735" "DUDE" "Just ask him if he--ask him about  the car, man!"
"736" "WALTER" "Is this yours, Larry?  Is this your  homework, Larry?"
"737" "DUDE" "Is the car out front yours?"
"738" "WALTER" "Is this your homework, Larry?"
"739" "DUDE" "We know it's his fucking homework,  Walter!  Where's the fucking money,  you little brat?"
"740" "WALTER" "Look, Larry... Have you ever heard  of Vietnam?"
"741" "DUDE" "Oh, for Christ's sake, Walter!"
"742" "WALTER" "You're going to enter a world of  pain, son.  We know that this is  your homework.  We know you stole a  car--"
"743" "DUDE" "And the fucking money!"
"744" "WALTER" "And the fucking money.  And we know  that this is your homework, Larry."
"745" "WALTER" "You're gonna KILL your FATHER, Larry!."
"746" "WALTER" "Ah, this is pointless."
"747" "WALTER" "All right, Plan B.  You might want  to watch out the front window there,  Larry."
"748" "WALTER" "This is what happens when you FUCK a  STRANGER in the ASS, Larry."
"749" "WALTER" "Fucking language problem, Dude."
"750" "WALTER" "Maybe he'll understand this."
"751" "WALTER" "YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS, LARRY!"
"752" "WALTER" "YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS?!"
"753" "WALTER" "THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU FUCK A  STRANGER IN THE ASS!"
"754" "WALTER" "HERE'S WHAT HAPPENS, LARRY!"
"755" "WALTER" "HERE'S WHAT HAPPENS!  FUCK A STRANGER  IN THE ASS!"
"756" "MAN" "WHAT THE FUCK JOO DOING, MANG?!"
"757" "MAN" "I JUS' BAWDEEZ FUCKEEN CAR LASS WEEK!"
"758" "WALTER" "Hunh?"
"759" "MAN" "I KILL JOO, MANG!  I--I KILL JOR  FUCKEEN CAR!"
"760" "DUDE" "No!  No!  NO!  THAT'S NOT--"
"761" "MAN" "I FUCKEEN KILL JOR FUCKEEN CAR!"
"762" "MAN" "I KILL JOR FUCKEEN CAR!"
"763" "MAN" "I KILL JOR FUCKEEN CAR!"
"764" "DUDE" "I accept your apology... No I, I  just want to handle it myself from  now on... No.  That has nothing to  do with it... Yes, it made it home,  I'm calling from home.  No, Walter,  it didn't look like Larry was about  to crack."
"765" "DUDE" "Well that's your perception...  Well  you're right, Walter, and the unspoken  Message is FUCK YOU AND LEAVE ME THE  FUCK ALONE... Yeah, I'll be at  practice."
"766" "DUDE" "Huh?"
"767" "WOO" "Pin your diapers on, Lebowski.  Jackie  Treehorn wants to see you."
"768" "BLOND MAN" "And we know which Lebowski you are,  Lebowski."
"769" "WOO" "Yeah.  Jackie Treehorn wants to talk  to the deadbeat Lebowski."
"770" "BLOND MAN" "You're not dealing with morons here."
"771" "MAN" "Hello Dude, thanks for coming.  I'm  Jackie Treehorn."
"772" "DUDE" "This is quite a pad you got here,  man.  Completely unspoiled."
"773" "TREEHORN" "What's your drink, Dude?"
"774" "DUDE" "White Russian, thanks.  How's the  smut business, Jackie?"
"775" "TREEHORN" "I wouldn't know, Dude.  I deal in  publishing, entertainment, political  advocacy, and--"
"776" "DUDE" "Which one was Logjammin'?"
"777" "TREEHORN" "Regrettably, it's true, standards  have fallen in adult entertainment.   It's video, Dude.  Now that we're  competing with the amateurs, we can't  afford to invest that little extra  in story, production value, feeling."
"778" "TREEHORN" "People forget that the brain is the  biggest erogenous zone--"
"779" "DUDE" "On you, maybe."
"780" "TREEHORN" "Of course, you do get the good with  the bad.  The new technology permits  us to do exciting things with  interactive erotic software.  Wave  of the future, Dude.  100% electronic."
"781" "DUDE" "Uh-huh.  Well, I still jerk off  manually."
"782" "TREEHORN" "Of course you do.  I can see you're  anxious for me to get to the point.   Well Dude, here it is.  Where's Bunny?"
"783" "DUDE" "I thought you might know, man."
"784" "TREEHORN" "Me?  How would I know?  The only  reason she ran off was to get away  from her rather sizable debt to me."
"785" "DUDE" "But she hasn't run off, she's been--"
"786" "TREEHORN" "I've heard the kidnapping story, so  save it.  I know you're mixed up in  all this, Dude, and I don't care  what you're trying to take off her  husband.  That's your business.  All  I'm saying is, I want mine."
"787" "DUDE" "Yeah, well, right man, there are  many facets to this, uh, you know,  many interested parties.  If I can  find your money, man-- what's in it  for the Dude?"
"788" "TREEHORN" "Of course, there's that to discuss.   Refill?"
"789" "DUDE" "Does the Pope shit in the woods?"
"790" "TREEHORN" "Let's say a 10% finder's fee?"
"791" "DUDE" "Okay, Jackie, done.  I like the way  you do business.  Your money is being  held by a kid named Larry Sellers.   He lives in North Hollywood, on  Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger.   A real fuckin' brat, but I'm sure  your goons'll be able to get it off  him, mean he's only fifteen and he's  flunking social studies.  So if you'll  just write me a check for my ten per  cent... of half a million... fifty  grand."
"792" "DUDE" "I'll go out and mingle.--Jesus, you  mix a hell of a Caucasian, Jackie."
"793" "TREEHORN" "A fifteen-year-old?  Is this your  idea of a joke?"
"794" "DUDE" "No funny stuff, Jackie... the kid's  got it.  Hiya, fellas... kid just  wanted a car.  All the Dude ever  wanted... was his rug back... not  greedy... it really..."
"795" "THE STRANGER'S VOICE" "Darkness warshed over the Dude--  darker'n a black steer's tookus on a  moonless prairie night.  There was  no bottom."
"796" "DUDE" "He was innocent.  Not a charge was  true.  And they say he ran awaaaaaay."
"797" "CHIEF" "This is your only I.D.?"
"798" "DUDE" "I know my rights."
"799" "CHIEF" "You don't know shit, Lebowski."
"800" "DUDE" "I want a fucking lawyer, man.  I  want Bill Kunstler."
"801" "CHIEF" "What are you, some kind of sad-assed  refugee from the fucking sixties?"
"802" "DUDE" "Uh-huh."
"803" "CHIEF" "Mr. Treehorn tells us that he had to  eject you from his garden party,  that you were drunk and abusive."
"804" "DUDE" "That guy treats women like objects,  man."
"805" "CHIEF" "Mr. Treehorn draws a lot of water in  this town, Lebowski.  You don't draw  shit.  We got a nice quiet beach  community here, and I aim to keep it  nice and quiet.  So let me make  something plain.  I don't like you  sucking around bothering our citizens,  Lebowski.  I don't like your jerk- off name, I don't like your jerk-off  face, I don't like your jerk-off  behavior, and I don't like you, jerk- off--do I make myself clear?"
"806" "DUDE" "I'm sorry, I wasn't listening."
"807" "DUDE" "--Ow!  Fucking fascist!"
"808" "CHIEF" "Stay out of Malibu, Lebowski!"
"809" "CHIEF" "Stay out of Malibu, deadbeat!  Keep  your ugly fucking goldbricking ass  out of my beach community!"
"810" "DUDE" "Jesus, man, can you change the  station?"
"811" "DRIVER" "Fuck you man!  You don't like my  fucking music, get your own fucking  cab!"
"812" "DUDE" "I've had a--"
"813" "DRIVER" "I pull over and kick your ass out,  man!"
"814" "DUDE" "--had a rough night, and I hate the  fucking Eagles, man--"
"815" "DRIVER" "That's it!  Outta this fucking cab!"
"816" "DUDE" "Jesus."
"817" "MAUDE" "Jeffrey."
"818" "DUDE" "Maude?"
"819" "MAUDE" "Love me."
"820" "DUDE" "That's my robe."
"821" "MAUDE" "Tell me a little about yourself,  Jeffrey."
"822" "DUDE" "Well, uh... Not much to tell."
"823" "DUDE" "I was, uh, one of the authors of the  Port Huron Statement.--The original  Port Huron Statement."
"824" "MAUDE" "Uh-huh."
"825" "DUDE" "Not the compromised second draft.   And then I, uh... Ever hear of the  Seattle Seven?"
"826" "MAUDE" "Mmnun."
"827" "DUDE" "And then... let's see, I uh--music  business briefly."
"828" "MAUDE" "Oh?"
"829" "DUDE" "Yeah.  Roadie for Metallica.  Speed  of Sound Tour."
"830" "MAUDE" "Uh-huh."
"831" "DUDE" "Bunch of assholes.  And then, you  know, little of this, little of that.   My career's, uh, slowed down a bit  lately."
"832" "MAUDE" "What do you do for fun?"
"833" "DUDE" "Oh, you know, the usual.  Bowl.   Drive around.  The occasional acid  flashback."
"834" "MAUDE" "What happened to your house?"
"835" "DUDE" "Jackie Treehorn trashed the place.   Wanted to save the finder's fee."
"836" "MAUDE" "Finder's fee?"
"837" "DUDE" "He thought I had your father's money,  so he got me out of the way while he  looked for it."
"838" "MAUDE" "It's not my father's money, it's the  Foundation's.  Why did he think you  had it?  And who does?"
"839" "DUDE" "Larry Sellers, a high-school kid.   Real fucking brat."
"840" "MAUDE" "Jeffrey--"
"841" "DUDE" "It's a complicated case, Maude.   Lotta ins, lotta outs.  Fortunately  I've been adhering to a pretty strict,  uh, drug regimen to keep my mind,  you know, limber.  I'm real fucking  close to your father's money, real  fucking close.  It's just--"
"842" "MAUDE" "I keep telling you, it's the  Foundation's money.  Father doesn't  have any."
"843" "DUDE" "Huh?  He's fucking loaded."
"844" "MAUDE" "No no, the wealth was all Mother's."
"845" "DUDE" "But your father--he runs stuff, he--"
"846" "MAUDE" "We did let Father run one of the  companies, briefly, but he didn't do  very well at it."
"847" "DUDE" "But he's--"
"848" "MAUDE" "He helps administer the charities  now, and I give him a reasonable  allowance.  He has no money of his  own.  I know how he likes to present  himself; Father's weakness is vanity.   Hence the slut."
"849" "DUDE" "Huh.  Jeez.  Well, so, did he--is  that yoga?"
"850" "MAUDE" "It increases the chances of  conception."
"851" "DUDE" "Increases?"
"852" "MAUDE" "Well yes, what did you think this  was all about?  Fun and games?"
"853" "DUDE" "Well... no, of course not--"
"854" "MAUDE" "I want a child."
"855" "DUDE" "Yeah, okay, but see, the Dude--"
"856" "MAUDE" "Look, Jeffrey, I don't want a partner.   In fact I don't want the father to  be someone I have to see socially,  or who'll have any interest in rearing  the child himself."
"857" "DUDE" "Huh..."
"858" "DUDE" "So... that doctor."
"859" "MAUDE" "Exactly.  What happened to your face?   Did Jackie Treehorn do that as well?"
"860" "DUDE" "No, the, uh, police chief of Malibu.   A real reactionary... So your  father... Oh man, I get it!"
"861" "MAUDE" "What?"
"862" "DUDE" "Yeah, my thinking about the case,  man, it had become uptight.  Yeah.   Your father--"
"863" "PHONE VOICE" "This is Walter Sobchak.  I'm not in;  leave a message after the beep."
"864" "MAUDE'S VOICE" "What're you talking about?"
"865" "DUDE" "Walter, if you're there, pick up the  fucking phone.  Pick it up, Walter,  this is an emergency.  I'm not--"
"866" "WALTER" "Dude?"
"867" "DUDE" "Walter, listen, I'm at my place, I  need you to come pick me up--"
"868" "WALTER" "I can't drive, Dude, it's erev  shabbas."
"869" "DUDE" "Huh?"
"870" "WALTER" "Erev shabbas.  I can't drive.  I'm  not even supposed to pick up the  phone, unless it's an emergency."
"871" "DUDE" "It is a fucking emergency."
"872" "WALTER" "I understand.  That's why I picked  up the phone."
"873" "DUDE" "THEN WHY CAN'T YOU--fuck, never mind,  just call Donny then, and ask him to--"
"874" "WALTER" "Dude, I'm not supposed to make calls--"
"875" "DUDE" "WALTER, YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE, WE GOTTA  GO TO PASADENA!  COME  PICK ME UP OR  I'M OFF THE FUCKING BOWLING TEAM!"
"876" "MAUDE'S VOICE" "Jeffrey?"
"877" "DUDE" "Get out of that fucking car, man!"
"878" "DUDE" "Who the fuck are you, man!  Come on,  man!"
"879" "MAN" "Relax, man!  No physical harm  intended!"
"880" "DUDE" "Who the fuck are you?  Why've you  been following me?  Come on, fuckhead!"
"881" "MAN" "Hey, relax man, I'm a brother shamus."
"882" "DUDE" "Brother Shamus?  Like an Irish monk?"
"883" "MAN" "Irish m--What the fuck are you talking  about?  My name's Da Fino!  I'm a  private snoop!  Like you, man!"
"884" "DUDE" "Huh?"
"885" "DA FINO" "A dick, man!  And let me tell you  something: I dig your work. Playing  one side against the other--in bed  with everybody--fabulous stuff, man."
"886" "DUDE" "I'm not a--ah, fuck it, just stay  away from my fucking lady friend,  man."
"887" "DA FINO" "Hey hey, I'm not messing with your  special lady--"
"888" "DUDE" "She's not my special lady, she's my  fucking lady friend.  I'm just helping  her conceive, man!"
"889" "DA FINO" "Hey, man, I'm not--"
"890" "DUDE" "Who're you working for?  Lebowski?   Jackie Treehorn?"
"891" "DA FINO" "The Gundersons."
"892" "DUDE" "The?  Who the fff--"
"893" "DA FINO" "The Gundersons.  It's a wandering  daughter job.  Bunny Lebowski, man.   Her real name is Fawn Gunderson.   Her parents want her back."
"894" "DA FINO" "See?"
"895" "DUDE" "Jesus fucking Christ."
"896" "DA FINO" "Crazy, huh?  Ran away a year ago."
"897" "DA FINO" "The Gundersons told me to show her  this when I found her.  The family  farm."
"898" "DA FINO" "Outside of Moorhead, Minnesota.   They think it'll make her homesick."
"899" "DUDE" "Boy.  How ya gonna keep 'em down on  the farm once they seen Karl Hungus."
"900" "DUDE" "She's been kidnapped, Da Fino.  Or  maybe not, but she's definitely not  around."
"901" "DA FINO" "Fuck, man!  That's terrible!"
"902" "DUDE" "Yeah, it sucks."
"903" "DA FINO" "Well maybe you and me could pool our  resources--trade information--  professional courtesy--compeers, you  know--"
"904" "DUDE" "Yeah, I get it.  Fuck off, Da Fino.   And stay away from my special la--  from my fucking lady friend."
"905" "WAITRESS" "You folks ready?"
"906" "DIETER" "I haff lingenberry pancakes."
"907" "KIEFFER" "Lingenberry pancakes."
"908" "FRANZ" "Sree picks in blanket."
"909" "DIETER" "Lingenberry pancakes."
"910" "DUDE" "I mean we totally fucked it up, man.   We fucked up his pay-off.  And got  the kidnappers all pissed off, and  the big Lebowski yelled at me a lot,  but he didn't do anything.  Huh?"
"911" "WALTER" "Well it's, sometimes the cathartic,  uh."
"912" "DUDE" "I'm saying if he knows I'm a fuck- up, then why does he still leave me  in charge of getting back his wife?   Because he fucking doesn't want her  back, man!  He's had enough!  He no  longer digs her!  It's all a show!   But then, why didn't he give a shit  about his million bucks?  I mean, he  knew we didn't hand off his briefcase,  but he never asked for it back."
"913" "WALTER" "What's your point, Dude?"
"914" "DUDE" "His million bucks was never in it,  man!  There was no money in that  briefcase!  He was hoping they'd  kill her!  You throw out a ringer  for a ringer!"
"915" "WALTER" "Yeah?"
"916" "DUDE" "Shit yeah!"
"917" "WALTER" "Okay, but how does all this add up  to an emergency?"
"918" "DUDE" "Huh?"
"919" "WALTER" "I'm saying, I see what you're getting  at, Dude, he kept the money, but my  point is, here we are, it's shabbas,  the sabbath, which I'm allowed to  break only if it's a matter of life  and death--"
"920" "DUDE" "Walter, come off it.  You're not  even fucking Jewish, you're--"
"921" "WALTER" "What the fuck are you talking about?"
"922" "DUDE" "You're fucking Polish Catholic--"
"923" "WALTER" "What the fuck are you talking about?   I converted when I married Cynthia!   Come on, Dude!"
"924" "DUDE" "Yeah, and you were--"
"925" "WALTER" "You know this!"
"926" "DUDE" "And you were divorced five fucking  years ago."
"927" "WALTER" "Yeah?  What do you think happens  when you get divorced?  You turn in  your library card?  Get a new driver's  license?  Stop being Jewish?"
"928" "DUDE" "This driveway."
"929" "WALTER" "I'm as Jewish as fucking Tevye"
"930" "DUDE" "It's just part of your whole sick  Cynthia thing.  Taking care of her  fucking dog.  Going to her fucking  synagogue.  You're living in the  fucking past."
"931" "WALTER" "Three thousand years of beautiful  tradition, from Moses to Sandy Koufax--  YOU'RE GODDAMN RIGHT I LIVE IN THE  PAST!  I--Jesus.  What the hell  happened?"
"932" "WALTER" "Jesus Christ."
"933" "BRANDT" "He can't see you, Dude."
"934" "DUDE" "Where'd she been?"
"935" "BRANDT" "Visiting friends of hers in Palm  Springs.  Just picked up and left,  never bothered to tell us."
"936" "DUDE" "But I guess she told Dieter."
"937" "WALTER" "Jesus, Dude!  He never even kidnapped  her."
"938" "BRANDT" "Who's this gentleman, Dude?"
"939" "WALTER" "Who'm I?  I'm a fucking VETERAN!"
"940" "BRANDT" "You shouldn't go in there, Dude!   He's very angry!"
"941" "LEBOWSKI" "Well, she's back.  No thanks to you."
"942" "DUDE" "Where's the money, Lebowski?"
"943" "WALTER" "A MILLION BUCKS FROM FUCKING NEEDY  LITTLE URBAN ACHIEVERS!  YOU ARE  SCUM, MAN!"
"944" "LEBOWSKI" "Who the hell is he?"
"945" "WALTER" "I'll tell you who I am!  I'm the guy  who's gonna KICK YOUR PHONY  GOLDBRICKING ASS!"
"946" "DUDE" "We know the briefcase was empty,  man.  We know you kept the million  bucks yourself."
"947" "LEBOWSKI" "Well, you have your story, I have  mine.  I say I entrusted the money  to you, and you stole it."
"948" "WALTER" "AS IF WE WOULD EVER DREAM OF TAKING  YOUR BULLSHIT MONEY!"
"949" "DUDE" "You thought Bunny'd been kidnapped  and you could use it as a pretext to  make some money disappear.  All you  needed was a sap to pin it on, and  you'd just met me.  You thought,  hey, a deadbeat, a loser, someone  the square community won't give a  shit about."
"950" "LEBOWSKI" "Well?  Aren't you?"
"951" "DUDE" "Well... yeah."
"952" "LEBOWSKI" "All right, get out.  Both of you."
"953" "WALTER" "Look at that fucking phony, Dude!   Pretending to be a fucking  millionaire!"
"954" "LEBOWSKI" "I said out.  Now."
"955" "WALTER" "Let me tell you something else.   I've seen a lot of spinals, Dude,  and this guy is a fake.  A fucking  goldbricker."
"956" "WALTER" "This guy fucking walks.  I've never  been more certain of anything in my  life!"
"957" "LEBOWSKI" "Stay away from me, mister!"
"958" "WALTER" "Walk, you fucking phony!"
"959" "LEBOWSKI" "Put me down, you son of a bitch!"
"960" "DUDE" "Walter!"
"961" "WALTER" "It's all over, man!  We call your  fucking bluff!"
"962" "DUDE" "WALTER, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE!  HE'S  CRIPPLED!  PUT HIM DOWN!"
"963" "WALTER" "Sure, I'll put him down, Dude.  RAUSS!   ACHTUNG, BABY!!"
"964" "WALTER" "Oh, shit."
"965" "LEBOWSKI" "You're bullies!  Cowards, both of  you!"
"966" "WALTER" "Oh, shit."
"967" "DUDE" "He can't walk, Walter!"
"968" "WALTER" "Yeah, I can see that, Dude."
"969" "LEBOWSKI" "You monsters!"
"970" "DUDE" "Help me put him back in his chair."
"971" "WALTER" "Shit, sorry man."
"972" "LEBOWSKI" "Stay away from me!  You bullies!   You and these women!  You won't leave  a man his fucking balls!"
"973" "DUDE" "Walter, you fuck!"
"974" "WALTER" "Shit, Dude, I didn't know.  I  wouldn't've done it if I knew he was  a fucking crybaby."
"975" "DUDE" "We're sorry, man.  We're really sorry."
"976" "DUDE" "There ya go.  Sorry man."
"977" "WALTER" "Shit.  He didn't look like a spinal."
"978" "WALTER" "Sure you'll see some tank battles.   But fighting in desert is very  different from fighting in canopy  jungle."
"979" "DUDE" "Uh-huh."
"980" "WALTER" "I mean 'Nam was a foot soldier's war  whereas, uh, this thing should be a  fucking cakewalk.  I mean I had an  M16, Jacko, not an Abrams fucking  tank.  Just me and Charlie, man,  eyeball to eyeball."
"981" "DUDE" "Yeah."
"982" "WALTER" "That's fuckin' combat.  The man in  the black pyjamas, Dude.  Worthy  fuckin' adversary."
"983" "DONNY" "Who's in pyjamas, Walter?"
"984" "WALTER" "Shut the fuck up, Donny.  Not a bunch  of fig-eaters with towels on their  heads tryin' to find reverse on a  Soviet tank.  This is not a worthy--"
"985" "VOICE" "HEY!"
"986" "QUINTANA" "What's this "day of rest" shit, man?!"
"987" "QUINTANA" "What is this bullshit, man?  I don't  fucking care!  It don't matter to  Jesus!  But you're not fooling me!   You might fool the fucks in the league  office, but you don't fool Jesus!   It's bush league psych-out stuff!   Laughable, man!  I would've fucked  you in the ass Saturday, I'll fuck  you in the ass next Wednesday instead!"
"988" "QUINTANA" "You got a date Wednesday, man!"
"989" "WALTER" "He's cracking."
"990" "WALTER" "A tree of life, Dude.  To all who  cling to it."
"991" "DUDE" "They finally did it.  They killed my  fucking car."
"992" "DIETER" "Vee vant zat money, Lebowski."

"996" "DONNY" "Are these the Nazis, Walter?"
"997" "WALTER" "They're nihilists, Donny, nothing to  be afraid of."
"998" "DIETER" "Vee don't care.  Vee still vant zat  money or vee fuck you up."
"999" "KIEFFER" "Ja, vee still vant ze money.  Vee  sreaten you."

"1003" "DIETER" "Zere ARE no ROOLZ!"
"1004" "WALTER" "NO RULES!  YOU CABBAGE-EATING SONS- Of-BITCHES--"
"1005" "KIEFFER" "His girlfriend gafe up her toe!  She  sought we'd be getting million  dollars!  Iss not fair!"

"1007" "DUDE" "Hey, cool it Walter.  Listen, pal,  there never was any money.  The big  Lebowski gave me an empty briefcase,  man, so take it up with him."
"1008" "WALTER" "AND I'D LIKE MY UNDIES BACK!"
"1009" "DONNY" "Are they gonna hurt us, Walter?"

"1031" "WALTER" "We've got a man down, Dude."
"1032" "DUDE" "My God!  They shot him, Walter!"
"1033" "WALTER" "No Dude."
"1034" "DUDE" "They shot Donny!"
"1035" "WALTER" "There weren't any shots."
"1036" "DUDE" "Then what's..."
"1037" "WALTER" "It's a heart attack."
"1038" "DUDE" "Wha."
"1039" "WALTER" "Call the medics, Dude."
"1040" "DUDE" "Wha... Donny--"
"1041" "WALTER" "Hurry Dude.  I'd go but I'm pumping  blood.  Might pass out."
"1042" "WALTER" "Rest easy, good buddy, you're doing  fine.  We got help choppering in."
"1043" "MAN" "Hello, gentlemen.  You are the  bereaved?"
"1044" "DUDE" "Yeah man."
"1045" "MAN" "Francis Donnelly.  Pleased to meet  you."
"1046" "DUDE" "Jeffrey Lebowski."
"1047" "WALTER" "Walter Sobchak."
"1048" "DUDE" "The Dude, actually.  Is what, uh."
"1049" "DONNELLY" "Excuse me?"
"1050" "DUDE" "Nothing."
"1051" "DONNELLY" "Yes.  I understand you're taking  away the remains."
"1052" "WALTER" "Yeah."
"1053" "DONNELLY" "We have the urn."
"1054" "DONNELLY" "And I assume this is credit card?"
"1055" "WALTER" "Yeah."
"1056" "WALTER" "What's this?"
"1057" "DONNELLY" "That is for the urn."
"1058" "WALTER" "Don't need it.  We're scattering the  ashes."
"1059" "DONNELLY" "Yes, so we were informed.  However,  we must of course transmit the remains  to you in a receptacle."
"1060" "WALTER" "This is a hundred and eighty dollars."
"1061" "DONNELLY" "Yes sir.  It is our most modestly  priced receptacle."
"1062" "DUDE" "Well can we--"
"1063" "WALTER" "A hundred and eighty dollars?!"
"1064" "DONNELLY" "They range up to three thousand."
"1065" "WALTER" "Yeah, but we're--"
"1066" "DUDE" "Can we just rent it from you?"
"1067" "DONNELLY" "Sir, this is a mortuary, not a rental  house."
"1068" "WALTER" "We're scattering the fucking ashes!"
"1069" "DUDE" "Walter--"
"1070" "WALTER" "JUST BECAUSE WE'RE BEREAVED DOESN'T  MEAN WE'RE SAPS!"
"1071" "DONNELLY" "Sir, please lower your voice--"
"1072" "DUDE" "Hey man, don't you have something  else you could put it in?"
"1073" "DONNELLY" "That is our most modestly priced  receptacle."
"1074" "WALTER" "GODDAMNIT!  IS THERE A RALPH'S AROUND  HERE?!"
"1075" "WALTER" "I'll say a few words."
"1076" "WALTER" "Donny was a good bowler, and a good  man.  He was... He was one of us.   He was a man who loved the outdoors,  and bowling, and as a surfer explored  the beaches of southern California  from Redondo to Calabassos.  And he  was an avid bowler.  And a good  friend.  He died--he died as so many  of his generation, before his time.   In your wisdom you took him, Lord.   As you took so many bright flowering  young men, at Khe San and Lan Doc  and Hill 364.  These young men gave  their lives.  And Donny too.  Donny  who... who loved bowling."
"1077" "WALTER" "And so, Theodore--Donald--Karabotsos,  in accordance with what we think  your dying wishes might well have  been, we commit your mortal remains  to the bosom of..."
"1078" "WALTER" "the Pacific Ocean, which you loved  so well."
"1079" "WALTER" "Goodnight, sweet prince."
"1080" "WALTER" "Shit, I'm sorry Dude."
"1081" "WALTER" "Goddamn wind."
"1082" "DUDE" "Goddamnit Walter!  You fucking  asshole!"
"1083" "WALTER" "Dude!  Dude, I'm sorry!"
"1084" "DUDE" "You make everything a fucking  travesty!"
"1085" "WALTER" "Dude, I'm--it was an accident!"
"1086" "DUDE" "What about that shit about Vietnam!"
"1087" "WALTER" "Dude, I'm sorry--"
"1088" "DUDE" "What the fuck does Vietnam have to  do with anything!  What the fuck  were you talking about?!"
"1089" "WALTER" "Shit Dude, I'm sorry--"
"1090" "DUDE" "You're a fuck, Walter!"
"1091" "WALTER" "Awww, fuck it Dude.  Let's go bowling."
"1092" "DUDE" "Two oat sodas, Gary."
"1093" "GARY" "Right.  Good luck tomorrow."
"1094" "DUDE" "Thanks, man."
"1095" "GARY" "Sorry to hear about Donny."
"1096" "DUDE" "Yeah.  Well, you know, sometimes you  eat the bear, and, uh..."
"1097" "THE STRANGER" "Howdy do, Dude."
"1098" "DUDE" "Oh, hey man, how are ya?  I wondered  if I'd see you again."
"1099" "THE STRANGER" "Wouldn't miss the semis.  How things  been goin'?"
"1100" "DUDE" "Ahh, you know.  Strikes and gutters,  ups and downs."
"1101" "THE STRANGER" "Sure, I gotcha."
"1102" "DUDE" "Thanks, Gary... Take care, man, I  gotta get back."
"1103" "THE STRANGER" "Sure.  Take it easy, Dude--I know  that you will."
"1104" "DUDE" "Yeah man.  Well, you know, the Dude  abides."
"1105" "THE STRANGER" "The Dude abides."
"1106" "THE STRANGER" "I don't know about you, but I take  comfort in that.  It's good knowin'  he's out there, the Dude, takin' her  easy for all us sinners.  Shoosh.  I  sure hope he makes the finals.  Welp,  that about does her, wraps her all  up.  Things seem to've worked out  pretty good for the Dude'n Walter,  and it was a purt good story, dontcha  think?   Made me laugh to beat the  band.  Parts, anyway.  Course--I  didn't like seein' Donny go. But  then, happen to know that there's a  little Lebowski on the way.  I guess  that's the way the whole durned human  comedy keeps perpetuatin' itself,  down through the generations, westward  the wagons, across the sands a time  until--aw, look at me, I'm ramblin'  again.  Wal, uh hope you folks enjoyed  yourselves."
"1107" "THE STRANGER" "Catch ya further on down the trail."
"1108" "THE STRANGER" "...Say friend, ya got any more a  that good sarsaparilla?.."
